# Photo Credits

The images provided in these datasets were collected using
google image search with a usage rights filter of
"Labeled for reuse with modification".

Images which should not have passed that filter have been removed.
If any additional images should not have passed that filter, please
help us correct that by logging an issue or a pull request.

Some of the photos request proper attribution. We are happy
to provide that here:

* Many of the photos are by [Mike Mozart](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/14287454177/), Flickr [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)

## Modifications

* The process of gathering and classifying the images may have resulted in resizing or changing the format, but otherwise the original images were not altered.

* When displayed in the test UI (PowerAI Vision or the example web app), labels and bounding boxes are drawn on top of the images.
